# SleeperTradesGraph
This Python script uses the Sleeper API to gather data on the number of trades made by each player in your fantasy football league, and generates a graph to visualize this data. Use this to see who is active among your league in trades to find potential trade partners.

It will look at all the trades for whatever league ID you give it, so if you want to see all of the trades in your league for 2022 or 2021 you'll have to navigate to those leagues in Sleeper to get their League IDs. 

Sleeper API Documentation: https://docs.sleeper.com/#introduction

You'll need the league ID for your league. This can be found in the URL of your Sleeper league: https://sleeper.com/leagues/<this_number_right_here>/matchup. Or if you open the App and go to your league -> League tab -> Settings (the gear icon) -> General, and then scroll to the bottom.
